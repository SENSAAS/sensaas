## Requirements

SENSAAS relies on the open-source library [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org). The current release of SENSAAS uses **Open3D version 0.12.0 along with Python3.7**.

Visit the following URL for using Python packages distributed via PyPI: [http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html) or conda: [https://anaconda.org/open3d-admin/open3d/files](https://anaconda.org/open3d-admin/open3d/files). For example, for windows-64, you can download *win-64/open3d-0.12.0-py37_0.tar.bz2*


## Virtual environment for python with conda (for Windows for example)

Install conda or Miniconda from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)  
Launch Anaconda Prompt, then complete the installation:

	conda update conda
	conda create -n sensaas
	conda activate sensaas
	conda install python=3.7 numpy
 
Once Open3D downloaded:
  
 	conda install open3d-0.12.0-py37_0.tar.bz2

(Optional) Additional packages for visualization with PyMOL:

  	conda install -c schrodinger -c conda-forge pymol-bundle
  
Retrieve and unzip SENSAAS repository in your desired folder. See below for running the program **sensaas.py** or **meta-sensaas.py**. The directory containing executables is called sensaas-main.

## Linux

Install:

1. Python3.7 and numpy
2. Open3D version 0.12.0 (more information at [http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html))

(Optional) Install additional packages for visualization with PyMOL:

3. PyMOL (a molecular viewer; more information at [https://pymolwiki.org](https://pymolwiki.org))
  
Retrieve and unzip SENSAAS repository. The directory containing executables is called sensaas-main.

## MacOS

	Not tested

## Information on the third-party program NSC

NSC is used to efficiently generate point clouds of molecules and to calculate their surfaces. It is written in C and was developed by Frank Eisenhaber who kindly licensed its use in SENSAAS. **Please be advised that the use of NSC is strictly tied to SENSAAS and its code is released under the following [license](https://github.com/SENSAAS/sensaas/blob/main/License_NSC.txt)**. If the NSC license is an issue for your application or if you wish to use NSC independently of
SENSAAS, please contact the author Frank Eisenhaber (email: frank.eisenhaber@gmail.com) who will amicably manage your request.

**Executables nsc (for Linux) or ncs-win (for windows) are included in this repository.**

In case they do not work on your system, you may have to compile it using the source file nsc-300.c in directory src/. Instructions for compilation:

1. **for Windows**:
	The current executable nsc-win.exe was compiled by using [http://www.codeblocks.org](http://www.codeblocks.org). Rename the executable as nsc-win.exe because  'nsc-win.exe' is used to set the variable nscexe in the Python script sensaas.py

2. **for Linux**:

		cc src/nsc-300.c -lm
	
	rename a.out as nsc because 'nsc' is used to set the variable nscexe in the Python script sensaas.py:

		cp a.out nsc
	


## Run Sensaas
To align a Source molecule on a Target molecule, the syntax is:
	
	sensaas.py sdf molecule-target.sdf sdf molecule-source.sdf slog.txt optim
	
Example:

	sensaas.py sdf examples/IMATINIB.sdf sdf examples/IMATINIB_mv.sdf slog.txt optim
	
You may have to run the script as follows:

	python sensaas.py sdf examples/IMATINIB.sdf sdf examples/IMATINIB_mv.sdf slog.txt optim


Don't worry if you get the following warning from Open3D: "*Open3D WARNING KDTreeFlann::SetRawData Failed due to no data.*". It is observed with conda on 	windows.

Here, the source file IMATINIB_mv.sdf is aligned (**moved**) on the target file IMATINIB.sdf (**that does not move**). The output **tran.txt** contains the transformation matrix allowing the alignment of the source file (result in **Source_tran.sdf**). The **slog.txt** file details results with final scores of the aligned molecule (Source) on the last line. In the current example, the last line must look like:

	gfit= 1.000 cfit= 0.999 hfit= 0.996 gfit+hfit= 1.996

There are three different fitness scores but we only use 2 of them, gfit and hfit, to calculate gfit+hfit. More about [Fitness scores](https://github.com/SENSAAS/sensaas/blob/main/docs/index.rst#fitness-scores)

- gfit score estimates the geometric matching of point-based surfaces - it ranges between 0 and 1

- hfit score estimates the matching of colored points representing pharmacophore features - it ranges between 0 and 1

Thus, we calculate a hybrid score = gfit + hfit scores - **gfit+hfit ranges between 0 and 2**

   - A gfit+hfit score close to 2.0 means a perfect superimposition.

   - A gfit+hfit score > 1.0 means that similaries were identified.
   
## Run meta-sensaas.py

**1. Virtual Screening** 

This script is suited for performing virtual screenings of sdf files containing several molecules (database mode). For example, if you want to process a sdf file containing several conformers for Target and/or Source. A similarity matrix is provided along with a sdf file that contains all aligned Sources. The syntax is:

 	meta-sensaas.py molecules-target.sdf molecules-source.sdf
 
**Example**
 
 The following example works with 2 files from the directory examples/

	meta-sensaas.py examples/IMATINIB.sdf examples/IMATINIB_parts.sdf
	
You may have to run the script as follows:

	python meta-sensaas.py examples/IMATINIB.sdf examples/IMATINIB_parts.sdf

Here, the source file IMATINIB_parts.sdf contains 3 substructures that are aligned (**moved**) on the target file IMATINIB.sdf (**that does not move**). Outputs are:
- the file **bestsensaas.sdf** that contains the best ranked aligned Source
- the file **catsensaas.sdf** that contains all aligned Sources
- the file **matrix-sensaas.txt** that contains gfit+hfit scores (rows=Targets and columns=Sources)

**Post-processing**

Then, to ease the analysis of the results, the script utils/ordered-catsensaas.py can be used to generate files in descending order of score.

	utils/ordered-catsensaas.py matrix-sensaas.txt catsensaas.sdf

You may have to run the script as follows:

	python utils/ordered-catsensaas.py matrix-sensaas.txt catsensaas.sdf
	
or if you want to only retrieve solutions having a gfit+hfit score above a defined cutoff:

	python utils/ordered-catsensaas-cutoff.py matrix-sensaas.txt catsensaas.sdf 1.1
	

- the file **ordered-catsensaas.sdf** contains all aligned Sources in descending order of score
- the file **ordered-scores.txt** contains gfit+hfit scores in descending order

**Option -s**

When executing meta-sensaas.py, you can also select the score type by using the option -s (default is the score of the Source (**-s source**)):

	meta-sensaas.py molecules-target.sdf molecules-source.sdf -s mean

here the mean of the score of the target and of the aligned source will be used to rank solutions and to fill matrix-sensaas.txt. The option '-s mean' is interesting to favor source molecules that have the same size of the Target. More about [Options](https://github.com/SENSAAS/sensaas/blob/main/docs/index.rst#Tutorials)


**2. Finding alternative alignments and Clustering**

This option allows to repeat in order to find alternative alignments when they exist as for example when aligning a fragment on a large molecule. The syntax is:

  	meta-sensaas.py target.sdf source.sdf -r 10
 
 here 10 alignments of the Source will be generated and clustered. Outputs are:
 
 - the file **sensaas-1.sdf** with the best ranked alignment - it contains 2 molecules: first is Target and second the aligned Source
 - the file **sensaas-2.sdf** (if exists) with the second best ranked alignment - it contains 2 molecules: first is Target and second the aligned Source
 - ...
 - file **cat-repeats.sdf** that contains all aligned Sources

**Example** 

The following example works with 2 files from the directory examples/

	meta-sensaas.py examples/VALSARTAN.sdf examples/tetrazole.sdf -r 100
	
You may have to run the script as follows:

	python meta-sensaas.py examples/VALSARTAN.sdf examples/tetrazole.sdf -r 100

As described in the publication, outputs are:

- sensaas-1.sdf contains the self-matching superimposition
- sensaas-2.sdf contains the bioisosteric superimposition
- sensaas-3.sdf contains the geometric-only superimposition

## Visualization 

You can use any molecular viewer. For instance, you can use PyMOL if installed (see optional packages) to load the Target and the aligned Source(s):

after aligning IMATINIB_mv.sdf on IMATINIB.sdf using sensaas.py:

	pymol examples/IMATINIB.sdf Source_tran.sdf 

or after executing meta-sensaas.py with several molecules:

	pymol examples/IMATINIB.sdf bestsensaas.sdf catsensaas.sdf
	
or after the post-processing:

	pymol examples/IMATINIB.sdf ordered-catsensaas.sdf


or after executing meta-sensaas.py with the repeat option (State 1 is Target and State 2 is the aligned Source):
	
	pymol examples/VALSARTAN.sdf sensaas-1.sdf
